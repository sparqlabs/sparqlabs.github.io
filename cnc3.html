		<p><b>Material Size and Margins</b><br>
			You can add 1 inch to the length and width, then have symetrical as 0.5 for a margin around the model.<br>
			You can do this for when you want to cut a part out, and give it extra space between the piece and the outer material.<br>
			This is also where you should add tabs to your piece so that it will stay attached to the material while cutting.

		<p><b>Roughing Toolpath</b><br>
			Here are example settings for a roughing toolpath. (You might want to set the pass depth to be a bit deeper though, to go faster).<br>
			Changing the Toolpath Strategy will make the "pattern" that the bit makes different. 3D raster is usually longer, but you might get better results.

		<p><b>Finishing Toolpath</b><br>
			Here are example settings for a finishing toolpath. The finishing toolpath is for when you want to reach areas that the roughing did not and clean up some areas.

		<p><b>Pocket</b><br>
			If you want to mill out some pockets that you added to your design (say, for hold-downs), then you can use the tool to create a pocket toolpath:

		<p>On that screen, you can select which vectors you want to cut by the Vector Selector. So if the vectors that you want cut are on a sepparate layer, this makes it easy:</p>

		<p><b>Preview Mode</b><br>
			The preview mode is helpful for seeing what will be milled. If you made any changes, remember to reset the preview.</p>

		<p><b>Export Toolpaths</b><br>
			You can save the toolpaths that you want to cut to a file by selecting the toolpaths that you want in the list near the bottom. Make sure at the top 'Output all visible toolpaths to one file' is checked.
