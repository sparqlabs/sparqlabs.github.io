		Levelling Build Platform on Duplicator 4

		<p>Levelling can be done by levelling process on the machine where you move a card in between the nozzle and build platform, but sometimes the 'tug' of the card can vary and you won't get an as reliable result.</p>

		<p>One way that seems to work well is printing a model that extends to the four corners, like <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:80153/#files" target="_blank">this one</a>. You can observe how it is printing and turn the dials.</p>

		<p>Thinner line = platform needs to move up = turn clockwise<br><br>
			Too thick line / almost transperent / scratching the build platform (tape) = platform needs to move down = turn counter clockwise</p>

		<p>It's a good idea to level the build platform before the first print of a day. As well as before a long print. Make sure there are no curls in the tape, as that could cause some problems with the print.</p>
