		<h3>Introduction</h3>

		<p>One day I lost the cap that came with my water bottle, which possibly meant an end to the happy days of swinging around the bottle with boundless content. I first called up the seller of the bottle and asked if I could buy a replacement – the answer was no. So I decided to do the next best thing - 3D print one for myself.</p>

		<h3>1st Iteration</h3>

		<p>I have <i>never</i> touched a CAD program in my life, so I looked up a list of free to use, Mac compatible programs and picked the beginner-oriented <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/design" target="_blank">Autodesk 123D Design</a> that suited my purposes ideally. It was not only Mac compatible but also played nicely with the most popular 3D printers.</p>

		<p>Next, I quickly learned some basic techniques through Autodesk’s YouTube channel and proceeded to make the first iteration of the cap which took me over 3 hours in total (luckily, my sister had the same bottle and was able to take measurements of the cap while I eyeballed them through Photoshop).</p>

		<p>1st iteration CAD model. Total time, 3+ hours. I figured out the trick behind building the thread by splitting a torus, angling it, and duplicating it to create a spiral. Then the spiral is flattened and the desirable part cut out using a subtract tool (with the cap’s walls being the “slicing edge”). </p>

		<p>I used the Makerbot Replicator (5th Generation) to print the part with white PLA filament, which took roughly an hour. It was quite exciting to print something for the first time.</p>

		<p>But it did not work! It turns out the threads were not far out enough and the cap was now just a bottle hat. I learned my first lesson here – always take precise measurements! (Which in hindsight is something that should have been painfully obvious).</p>

		<h3>2nd iteration</h3>

		<p>With experienced assistance, I was introduced to a digital caliper and we followed the wisdom of the first lesson. I expanded the thread and used a modified rectangle as a dummy-measuring tool to measure the spacing (I am sure there was a better way to do it but the built-in ruler tool was surprisingly limited in this application).</p>

		<p>2nd iteration CAD model. Total time, 1.4 hours.</p>

		<p>I had a high confidence in this iteration because the thread spacing was right and the thread angle seemed fine. Printed it once again and…</p>

		<p>2nd iteration printed model. Not visible: the water drops that leaked. The cap could only be forcefully screwed on an angle.</p>

		<img src="images/bottle_cap/bottle_cap_6.jpg" />

		<p>Nope, it was quite strange that the cap didn’t fit well since we followed lesson #1 and it was a problem of over fitting this time. I decided to retake the measurements with the caliper and found a surprise. The bottle spout isn’t circular! In fact, it is a very slight oval and we happened to take a shorter side of it. I have since revised lesson #1 to be:</p>

		<p><b>"Always take precise measurements <i>meticulously</i>!"</b></p>

		<h3>3rd Iteration</h3>

		<p>We now followed revised lesson #1 and took the longest side, which was roughly .7mm off from our previous width. I also made a small adjustment to the thread angle as the cap’s thread seemed to be too flat and rebuilt the thread from scratch.</p>

		<p>3rd iteration CAD model. Total time, 1 hour. Translucent cap with blue thread.</p>

		<p>I had very high confidence in this iteration to be successful (3rd time’s the charm).
			<br><br>
		And it was!
			<br><br>
		The cap glided on and screwed on to provide a robust seal.</p>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>

		<p>While a humble design compared to some of the projects my friends over in Engineering execute, I nonetheless experienced pride in the design’s success. I learned the nuts and bolts of a CAD program and thus gained another dimension (however basic) in my tool set. I will be using this bottle for quite a while, and in the meantime the cap will serve as a joyful reminder of the excitement of creating practical things.</p>

		<p>My appreciation goes out to SparQ Labs for assisting me with this project.</p>
